# cord-gateway
Essentially a Discord message relay bot.

## how use
This bot uses "*portals*" to configure endpoints.

### wdym
`gate?blue` - Open a *blue* portal  
`gate?orange` - Open an *orange* portal  

You don't need to open portals in order. As long as both portals are open, the bot will be relaying messages.

### HOW DO I STOP IT
`gate?reset` to close both portals  
`gate?status` to view what portals are open  

Keep in mind that this bot has actual error handling, and it WILL complain if you delete a channel that is bound to a portal.

## will it sell my data to meta
maybe

## some disclaimers
This bot uses webhooks, so it WILL wreck your server audit.  
Plus, I am not responsible for server deletions, very large conflicts, Discord going bankrupt, or nuclear war. If you point your finger at me, I will laugh at you, and you will cry.  

if you have problems with the bot, please submit an issue like a serious human being and not complain in my Discord DMs.
